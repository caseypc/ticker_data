		- (as early in the day as possible. Preferably starting @ 09:30)
	- B: look at 1 min - 5 min slice
		- Compute total 5 min gain
		- then look at commulative gains between each detail slice
			- 1m - 2m = B1
			- 2m - 3m = B2
			- 3m - 4m = B3
			- 4m - 5m = B4
			- Nm - N+1m = BN
		- Assertain...
			- is B1 the greatest gain (i.e. a straight-up spike? across B1, B2, B3, B4)
			- are the remaining slice gains(B2, B3, B4) flat? i.e. >= B1 (i.e. small) 
			or...
			- is B1 similar_to B2, B3, B4.... (i.e. a steady % gain up, or linear, for <linear )
			or...
			look at a bigger slice, and figgure out if A slow-start pattern happens somewhere else
			 in the slice window.
