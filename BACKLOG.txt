    - of Top 10 ticker symbols per minute
    - shows which symbols are up & coming & which are trailing off

        - 2.2 Fast drop-offs

3. Top10 Hot new upstarts
    - referencing #1 -> call-out symbols that appear on Top10
    - all of a sudden, out of nowhere
    - based on the previous Top10 list over the past X mins (def=10mins)
        - Fast jumpers (symbol quickly appears in high ranked pos, not 10th )
        - Slow crawlers (symbol creeps in at 10th & moves up, 9th, 8th, 7th...)

4.  Top10 Losers

5.  Fast Migrations

7.  How to use Filters on finance.yahoo.com URL
    - for alt data extraction criteria, especially...
        - Market cap (smaller MCcap's have greater intraday volatility)
        - Intraday volume
        - sorted by % gain, then Cur_price with range filtering ($10-$50)

8.  Find the Slow Crawl Starter that ends up being a full day linear run-up
	- A: look at 1 min ticks over a 5 mins slice
		- (as early in the day as possible. Preferably starting @ 09:30)
	- B: look at 1 min - 5 min slice
		- Compute total 5 min gain
		- then look at cumulative gains between each detail slice
			- 1m - 2m = B1
			- 2m - 3m = B2
			- 3m - 4m = B3
			- 4m - 5m = B4
			- Nm - N+1m = BN
		- Ascertain
			- is B1 the greatest gain (i.e. a straight-up spike? across B1, B2, B3, B4)
			- are the remaining slice gains(B2, B3, B4) flat? i.e. >= B1 (i.e. small)
			or...
			- is B1 similar to B2, B3, B4.... (i.e. a steady % gain up, or linear, for <linear )
			or...
			look at a bigger slice, and figure out if A slow-start pattern happens somewhere else
			 in the slice window.

9.  Screener #1
        Personal screener logic
            1. Market Cap > 750M
            2. Avg closing price > $5.0
            3. % gain > 4%
