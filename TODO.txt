1. BUG #1 : extraction is dropping/ignoring each 2nd line of data in the table

2. push extracted data into pandas dataframe

3. mongodb (or AWS equiv)

4. 1st 300 seconds timeframe of data is where all the large % moves happen
    1. 1st 60 seconds new price is set (no trades possible)
    2. compare to previous days close
    3. compare to 2nd 60 second window 
    4. compare to 3rd 60 second window
    5. comapre to 4th 60 second window
    6. inferr (quickly) 300 second window trend (up/down/flat)
    7. make inferrence on 5th 60 second window

5. Micro/Small cap stocks ($1B Mkt cap & below) are not shown soon after open
    1. as some medium/large cap stocks are slow to open & build momentum
    2. their momentum eventually pushes small cap stocks off the ticker data stream
       - mostly due to Yahoo Finance own display logic
    3. even though small cap stock will have a much greate %change & hence trade oppotunity

6. command line args
